[Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 1)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)

## Scope

We expect all community participants, contributors, paid or otherwise, sponsors,
and other guests to abide by this _Code of Conduct_ in all community venues
—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to
community business.

## Purpose

The primary goal of all the **conferences, user groups and other social spaces** that refer to
this _Code of Conduct_ is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most
varied and diverse backgrounds possible.

As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status,
or lack thereof, and every other _feature_.

This _Code of Conduct_ outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our
community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in our events to help us
create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this _Code of Conduct_ is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship
by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and
their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract
the many _Forms of Unfair Treatment and Abuses of Power_ that exist in society.

_If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming_, _friendly_,
_and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent_, _we want to know_.

## Unacceptable Behavior

_Unacceptable Behavior_ **includes but is not limited to**

- intimidating,
- harassing,
- abusive,
- discriminatory,
- derogatory or
- demeaning speech or actions

**By any Participant in Our Community** _online_, _at all related events
and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business_.

_Harassment_ **includes but is not limited to**

- harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to
  - gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability;
  - inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides);
  - inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides);
  - deliberate intimidation, stalking or following;
  - harassing photography or recording;
  - sustained disruption of talks or other events;
  - inappropriate physical contact, and
  - unwelcome sexual attention.

Community event venues may be shared with members of the public;
please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

_Unacceptable Behavior_ from any community member, _including sponsors and those with decision-making authority_,
will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in _Unacceptable Behavior_, the community organizers may take any action
they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community
**without warning** and **without refund** in the case of a paid event.

### Be a Witness or a Victim of Unacceptable Behavior

<!-- Witnesses, Victims and Offenders -->

**If You are a Witness or a Victim of Unacceptable Behavior**, or have **any other concerns**,
please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.

You find a [list of organizers](#list-of-organizers) to contact for each of
the supporters of this _Code of Conduct_ at the bottom of this page [^3].

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members
engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
_Unacceptable Behavior_ feel safe. In the context of in-person events,
organizers will _also provide escorts as desired_ by the person experiencing distress.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this _Code of Conduct_,
you should notify one of the event organizers with a concise description of your grievance.

Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.
